# Emulation Test Scenarios

Note: These assume the database is initially empty!

Using optional Disruptions in the http call, we can inject emulated failures at multiple levels to verify that the flow is managed appropriately. The Flow manager library takes care of the details, only requiring that the activities themselves correctly distinguish between fatal and non-fatal errors.

This allows us to implement Flow Managed Durable Functions with a high degree of confidence.

*/
/*
When Disruptions are detected, the base options are preset to minimal values to expedite testing. Otherwise the options are based on the activity flags. The last three flags can be used in combinations: the leftmost true value applies. Disrupted overwrites all, and default is simply without any other flag. These are, at the time of writing:
Setting|Disrupted|Default|HighMemory|LongRunning|HighDataOrFile
--|--|--|--|--|--
Number of Retries  |1      |5        |10        |10         |5
Initial Delay      |2 min  |5 min    |10 min    |8 min      |10 min       
Backoff Coefficient|1.0x   |2.0x     |1.4141x   |1.4141x    |2x    
Max Delay          |3 hr   |3 hr     |3 hr      |3 hr       |3 hr
Timeout            |10 min |2 hr     |6 hr      |12 hr      |8 hr
